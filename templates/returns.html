      <p class="muted-note">This page is theatrical and playfully villainous. It is written for entertainment and clarity — not legal advice. For formal return/refund policies consult a qualified professional.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h4>1. Our Grand Return Promise (Mostly Generous)</h4>
      <p>If you change your mind, we accept returns within 30 days of delivery on most items, provided the item is in its original condition, not mysteriously transformed by alchemy, and accompanied by proof of purchase. Some items (custom, perishable, or otherwise enchanted) may be final sale.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h4>2. How to Return (Summon the Courier)</h4>
      <p>Start by using the <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">Contact</a> page to request a return. We'll provide instructions, a return address, and any required incantations (mostly logistical details). Please package items carefully — damaged returns may reduce your refund or be denied.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h4>3. Refunds (Coins and Consolation)</h4>
      <p>Refunds will be issued to the original payment method after we receive and inspect the returned item. Allow up to 14 business days for processing. If we suspect the item was used for villainous experiments, we may withhold part of the refund (this is satire — actual decisions will follow reasonable policies).</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h4>4. Exchanges</h4>
      <p>Exchanges are possible if the replacement item is available. Contact us to arrange an exchange; we'll coordinate shipping and any price differences with the seriousness of a courtroom playwright.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h4>5. Shipping Costs</h4>
      <p>Return shipping costs are the customer's responsibility unless the return is due to our error (wrong item, defective, or cursed on arrival). In those cases, we'll cover return shipping and offer a hearty apology.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h4>6. Non-Returnable Items</h4>
      <p>Certain items cannot be returned: perishable goods, custom-made items, digital downloads, and items obviously altered for mischief. If in doubt, ask via <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">Contact</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h4>7. Fraud & Abuse</h4>
      <p>We reserve the right to refuse refunds in cases of suspected fraud or abuse of the return process. We take this seriously and will investigate suspicious patterns (multiple returns of identical items, obvious misuse, or attempts to game the system). No villainy tolerated.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h4>8. Questions</h4>
      <p>For return requests, issues, or dramatic appeals, use the <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">Contact</a> page and include your order details. We will respond after appropriate deliberation and possibly a dramatic sigh.</p>
