      <h3>Personal Message</h3>
      <div class="alert alert-light border-primary" role="alert">
        <p class="mb-1"><strong>To Mr Fong,</strong></p>
        <p>
          I just wanted to leave a message to say how much your teaching has meant to me. I will truly miss having you as my software teacher. You’re the person who inspired me to start programming in the first place, and you encouraged me through every challenge, every bug, and every moment I thought I wasn’t good enough. Your patience, enthusiasm, and genuine passion for what you teach have made you the best teacher I’ve ever had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything I’ve learned this year — and this project itself — exists because you helped me believe I could do it. Thank you for every lesson, every bit of advice, and every time you pushed me to think a little deeper. You’ve left a real impact on me, not just as a student, but as someone who now sees a future in programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish you all the best in whatever comes next for you. Any class, school, or student who gets you in the future is incredibly lucky.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">Thank you for everything.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">Your best student -Bean</p>
